# SatQuery AI — Delivery Schedule and Checkpoints

Last updated: 24 August 2026

## Delivery context

SatQuery AI must demonstrate domain-adapted remote-sensing analysis across
single-image, bi-temporal, and optical/SAR inputs. The delivered backend uses
deterministic local fallbacks so the complete demo remains runnable without a
GPU or network access. Model-training checkpoints are treated separately from
code completion: they must be produced by a reproducible external training run
and never substituted with fabricated benchmark claims.

## Schedule

| Checkpoint | Target | Deliverable | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | 24 Aug | Phase 5 adaptation workflow | Dataset manifest, Colab-ready notebook, adapter loading contract |
| C2 | 25 Aug | Phase 6 agent orchestration | Classifier, routed `/api/v1/agent`, auditable trace tests |
| C3 | 26 Aug | Phase 7 evidence | Overlay renderer and downloadable PDF report |
| C4 | 27 Aug | Phase 9 evaluation | Accuracy/IoU/F1 runner and evaluation manifest |
| C5 | 28 Aug | Phase 8 dashboard | React UI scaffold for uploads, results, trace, report export |
| C6 | 29–31 Aug | Integration rehearsal | Real RSVQA/BigEarthNet subset, model checkpoint import, API/UI demo |

## Checkpoint rules

- Every code checkpoint must include an automated test or a repeatable command.
- Training checkpoints must record base model, dataset version/split, seed,
  hyperparameters, metric, and artifact checksum in `Docs/training_runs/`.
- Do not mark a model adaptation or benchmark milestone complete until a real
  run produces weights and metrics.
- The offline spectral/backscatter specialists remain the demonstration fallback
  when trained artifacts are unavailable.

## Current status

- C1 — complete: BIFOLD BigEarthNet v2.0 selected; streaming manifest preparation, Colab notebook, LoRA entry point, artifact contract, and a real CUDA RSVQA adapter run are recorded in `Docs/training_runs/`.
- C2 — complete: transparent classifier, LangGraph StateGraph engine, thread-level checkpointing, and unified agent route verified.
- C3 — complete: mask overlay and PDF evidence export implemented.
- C4 — partially complete: metric runner executes against the available 10-row manifest, but a representative registry benchmark and adapted-versus-generic comparison remain required.
- C5 — implemented: React/Leaflet dashboard now includes upload, paired-image, result, trace, report, and evidence-view workflows; production build requires Node/npm dependencies, unavailable in the current environment.
- C6 — partially complete: selected training data, adapter checkpoint, GPU run, and API/UI integration are present; a larger real RSVQA/BigEarthNet rehearsal remains.
